                                    Hi! My name is Miguel √Ångel, but everyone calls me Mikel. I'm a software developer. Well, and also historian. And a joker (but not a smoker). But, above all, a web developer.
                                    </p>
                                    <br></br>
                                    <p>
                                        I was working in the public administration and decided to change my career.
                                        I made a huge step towards the tech field and came to Barcelona to do a course in web development, learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as Javascript and React as library to create responsive web apps.
                                        Also, I'm studying now a course in Java, using Spring as framework, to build strong and secured backend applications. I will finish the course in january.
                                        Besides, I have a strong background in office work and team leadership, as outlined in my CV.
                                        Moreover, I believe I possess very good soft skills dealing with people, bringing a good environmente in work and building good relationships with potential clients.
                                    </p>
                                    <br></br>
                                    <p>
                                        And what about me? Well, I used to play basketball for many years, so I love to watch basket matches. I like to play adventure videogames and my favorite one is <i>The Secret of Monkey Island</i> -will you transform me into one of that game's characters, please?.
                                        As I have said earlier, I'm a historian and a traveller. You can guess what kind of trips I like, right?
                                        And last, but not least, I'm from Bilbao, the capital of the world. And, of course, I'm a huge fan of Athletic Club de Bilbao.
                                        Hope you enjoy my portfolio!
